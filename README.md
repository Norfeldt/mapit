# MapIt

MapIt is a Chrome/Edge extension that allows you to quickly search for addresses and get directions on Google Maps. This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime - but the main usage of bun is to bundle the TS files chrome/edge uses V8 engine.

To install dependencies:

```zsh
bun install
```

One time bundling:

```zsh
bun dle
```

watch bundling (like auto reload)

```zsh
bun dlew
```
